# wasteclassifier
This project was created for Citrus Hack 2023 Sustainability Track @UC Riverside.

# what it does
It essentially classifies a user's waste into one of four categories. This was created to help uncertain yet good samaritans dispose of their wastes in the apporpriate manner.

# what is the point
The United States produces 268 million tons of waste with approximately 140 million going into landfills every year. On top of this the average American tosses 4.5 pounds of trash per day. These numbers are astronomically high. Unfortunately not all the items in the landfills are meant to be there. Some are considered hazardous and shouldn't even be close to facility workers. Other items can be recycle and reused in a sustainable manner. This app helps clear up the confusion as users can quickly check where their trash should be disposed.
